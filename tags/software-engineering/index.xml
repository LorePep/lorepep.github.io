      <description>We don&#39;t usually associate GO with a language to do mathematics, geometry or deep learning. Those tasks are usually left mainly to Python.
But is GO good at math as well?
Disclaimer
This post is an effort to share my experience and knowledge about the topic. Are there languages that are a better fit for math? Yes. Is it possible to do math (at least some simple things) with GO? Yes.</description>
