      <description>We don&#39;t usually associate GO with a language to do mathematics, geometry or deep learning. Those tasks are usually left mainly to Python.
But is GO good at math as well?
Let&#39;s try and explore the implementation of few simple mathematical problems using GO.
Pre-requisite To implement our code we will use gonum, which is a GO library for numerical and scientific algorithms. As a plus, it has nice plotting functions as well.</description>
