      <description>Today I was having some problems populating a proto repeated message in Python with a nested message definition, and it took me a while to figure out how to do it.
In reality it is pretty simple. Let&amp;rsquo;s make an example.
syntax = &amp;quot;proto3&amp;quot;; package test; message Trajectory2d { message Point2d { float x = 1; float y = 2; } repeated Point2d points = 1; } Let&amp;rsquo;s save our test.</description>

      <description>Table-driven tests are an elegant and functional way to unittest your functions in Go. Let&amp;rsquo;s see some ideas on how to introduce this same testing pattern in Python.
What are table-driven tests One thing I really love about Go is table-driven tests. If you are not familiar with them, table-driven tests are a very elegant way to write unittests for your code. The basic idea is that you write a list of named test cases, defining the input and the expected output for each test case, then you loop over the cases, run your function and check that the actual output is equal to the expected one.</description>
