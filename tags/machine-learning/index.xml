      <description>Last october I took part to the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrage Detection Kaggle challenge. I ended up in the top 10%, which considering my full-time job and travelling (at the time), was a placement I am quite happy with.
The goal of this post is to share some ideas and strategies to work with classifiation from DICOM images.
The task The task in this competition was to tackle a multiclass classification problem, with the goal of classifying 5 different types of brain hemorrage (+ non present) from computerized tomography (CT) scans of patient&#39;s heads.</description>

      <description>One very interesting computer vision problem is re-identification. The idea is that you have images of some entity and you want to be able to re-identify that entity in new images. As a complementary problem, you might also want to be able to say if an identity is known or not.
Classic use cases are people re-identification for surveillance, but there are also more fancy use cases such as whale re-identification for monitoring and conservation effort.</description>
